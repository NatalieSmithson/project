# Staff Alerts Week 4 Update
**Week beginning: 5 October 2020** 

Prepared by: Polly Sait and Simon Nebesnuick

## What we’ve been up to​ this week​

* We have had retrospective approval for the project!
* We have signed and MOU for officially using GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) on behalf of EA
* Polly has scheduled in user testing over the next 3 weeks, with a variety of user types (staff, message creators, message senders etc.)
* Simon has worked with the DDTS Cloud Services Centre team to secure a dev application environment that allows us to test using Azure Active Directory as the log in mechanism for our applications. This will allow staff, and those issues and approving messages to use their existing EA credentials to log in to the service
* Our developer, Dave, has been hard at work creating the first iteration of both the "contact application" and the "web application". These are hosted on GOV.UK PaaS and will be used for user testing in the coming weeks
* Ray has also been hard at work, creating the necessary data cleaning scripts that take the raw staff data, and transform it into something useful for the service to use. Good quality data is key to the whole service
* Polly and Simon have also been creating the materials need for user testing next week
* We had a good conversation with Chris, one of our SMEs, about how the service could be used in the future and the needs as BCIM Service Owner

## What we’re planning for ​next week

* User testing - we aim to use the first iteration services that are hosted on PaaS. If we cant use them, then we can fall back on our wireframe designs
* We will take feedback we get from user testing back into our designs and development for for the next iterations

## Blockers, Issue or Questions
