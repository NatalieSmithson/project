# Staff Alerts Week 5 Update
**Week beginning: 12 October 2020** 

Prepared by: Polly Sait and Simon Nebesnuick

## What we’ve been up to this week

* Polly and Simon have been user testing this week using the first iteration of both the "message application" and the "contact application". We have been getting some great insights, and will be feeding these back into new iterations of the applications. All users that we have spoken to so far have commented on how easy and straightforward the apps look
* We have created a draft questionnaire to send to users so that we can get more feedback and evidence of existing difficulties 
* Started creating a summary, for further discussion, of some of the main considerations for the future of the service. This includes some of the decisions which will need to be made on who can use the service and in what scenarios. This will also cover what we can do now and what developments will be left for future releases
* We have continued to finalise the design of the database and data cleaning processes
* Dave gave an overview of what we have done to the developer working on the Defra Group Text Alert Service that is in the design stages. He was very impressed with what he had achieved and suggested a future show and tell with the Defra team
* The GOV.UK Notify account used to actually send the text messages has now been made live
* We have compared the contacts registered in the current Rant and Rave system, with those we have collected from Office 365

## What we’re planning for next week

* Continue our user testing and hopefully send out the staff survey
* Agree the required system user roles (e.g. admin, manager etc.)
* As we are nearing completion of this project, we will need to start to focus on getting the app in a position to be formally deployed

## Blockers, issues or questions

* Creating the required Azure Application Registration may take some time and hold things up
* We need to progress with a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to ensure our designs comply with data protection rules

## Biggest risks

* Failing DPIA and having to reassess system design
