# Staff Alerts Week 5 Update
**Week beginning: 12 October 2020** 

Prepared by: Polly Sait and Simon Nebesnuick

## What we’ve been up to this week

* Polly and Simon have been user testing this week using the first iteration of both the "message application" and the "contact application". We have been getting some great insights, and will be feeding these back into new iterations of the applications
* All users that we have spoken to so far have commented on how easy and straightforward the app looks
* Created a questionnaire to send to users so that we can get more feedback and evidence of existing difficulties 
* Started creating a summary, for further discussion, of some of the main considerations for the future of the service. This includes some of the decisions which will need to be made on who can use the service and in what scenarios. Will also cover what we can do now and what developments will be left for future improvements.  
* Dave gave an overview of what we have done to Paul Shaw who is a developer working on the Defra alert system being created. He was very impressed with what he had achieved and suggested a future show and tell with the Defra team. Paul would also be someone who coule potentially work on our project going forward
* Gov.uk Notify account set up and running for the project


## What we’re planning for next week

* User testing will continue next week
* List of all contacts downloaded from the current Rand and Rave system will be compared to those from Azure
* As we are nearing completion of this project, we will need to start to focus on getting the app more in a position to be deployed

## Blockers, Issue or Questions

* Azure AD account set up is taking some time and may hold things up
* Questions raised over the need for a Data Protection Impact Assessment although much of this would be covered in th PaaS MOU
