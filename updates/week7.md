# Staff Alerts Week 7 Update
**Week beginning: 26 October 2020** 

Prepared by: Simon Nebesnuick

## What we’ve been up to​ this week​

* This is the final week of development on the Staff Alerts proof of concept work. A huge amount has been done in the last 7 weeks
* We had a show and tell with the service owner to go over our applications and design. We got great feedback!
* Working with the EA webmaster Kevin, we linked our applications to EA domains. These work with ZScaler but appear to be blocked by Connect2. Users can still access the applications using the "old" links so this is not a major issue
* 

## What we’re planning for ​next week

* TBC

## Blockers, Issue or Questions

* Decisions on where we take this next and what the next steps are may take some time


## Biggest risks

* None
