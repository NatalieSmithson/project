# Staff Alerts

## Introduction

The Staff Alerts service will provide a centralised facility which can rapidly inform staff of impacting events via text message. These alerts will protect the safety of staff within the organisation and limit loss of staff productivity. Key communications are time critical to business delivery, thus consistent and rapid delivery is fundamental.  

The intention is for this service to replace the existing EA Text Alerts service which is hard to maintain and manage.
