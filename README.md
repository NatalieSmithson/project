# Staff Alerts - Proposal

## Background

The Staff Alerts service will provide a centralised facility which can rapidly inform Environment Agency (EA) staff of incidents via text message. These alerts will protect the safety of staff within the organisation and limit loss of staff productivity. Key communications are time critical to business delivery, thus consistent and rapid delivery is fundamental.  

The intention is for this service to eventually replace the existing EA Text Alerts service which is hard to maintain and manage. The currently in progress "Defra Single Group Text Alert Service" project does **not** intend to replace the existing EA Text Alerts service.

## Goals

* To build a service to notify staff about business disruptions affecting the organisations sites and operational areas
* To create a quick, user-friendly and low-cost service
* To allow staff to “self-manage” their details
* To design a service that can be re-used by others


## Objectives

1. Identify and implement a way to securely obtain, maintain and store the necessary staff data across the organisation - following GDPR requirements

1. Identify and implement a way to securely allow staff to register, maintain and remove their own data from the service - following GDPR requirements

1. Create an accessible and intuitive internal interface that:
    1. allows for the issuing of messages by staff
    1. allows for basic staff data maintenance
    1. allows for the creation and maintenance of message templates
    1. 




1. Handover to Internal Digital Services


 do not have the people to take this on in the short term which is understood but be redesigning this will make it easier for future transition or adoption/re-use by Defra.

## Benefits

•	Provides a better service for users with lower overheads for future transition to Internal Digital Services (we appreciate in the short term their resource constraints mean this is not possible at present)
•	We can better meet the user needs we have seen and have had through feedback
•	Substantially reduces the maintenance overhead from the EDS team
•	Lower cost (current contract ~ around £40k)
•	We re-use components from XWS (NeXt Warning System) development (Text Alert service was an option proposed in Alpha)
•	In turn whatever is built can be open sourced and re-used by Defra or others without restriction
•	XWS benefits as it proves the warning engine for a non-flood scenario
•	Could help the removal one of the final EA (Environment Agency) websites
•	We use GDS (Government Digital Service) Notify for a free allocation of SMS messages
•	True agile delivery, opportunity for the team to use their skills
•	The team feel they are actively part of the solution
