# Staff Alerts

## Background

The Staff Alerts service will provide a centralised facility which can rapidly inform Environment Agency (EA) staff of incidents via text message. These alerts will protect the safety of staff within the organisation and limit loss of staff productivity. Key communications are time critical to business delivery, thus consistent and rapid delivery is fundamental.  

The intention is for this service to eventually replace the existing EA Text Alerts service which is hard to maintain and manage. 

The currently in progress "Defra Single Group Text Alert Service" project does **not** intend to replace the existing EA Text Alerts service.

## Objectives

1. Identify and implement a way to securely obtain, maintain and store the necessary staff data across the EA - following GDPR requirements

1. Identify and implement a way to securely allow staff to register, maintain and remove their data from the service - following GDPR requirements
