# Team Goals to Christmas
  This Describes the team goal to Christmas, our area to focus and the Progress we make

# Output/Goal by Christmas (23rd Dec)

##  Agree and validated Target Architecture that covers

  1.  Citizens in England to Register and unregister Online for area’s in England that they are interested in.
  2.  A Duty Officer/Incident Room can Issue, re-issue and Update warnings and those warning can be sent to key partners/dependencies in English
  3.  A Citizen can get a warning for the area (s) of interest that they have subscribed to via SMS/email/or Phone call and can unsubscribe - other channels may come later
So that we could build these feature


# Acceptance Criteria

##  How will we know that we are done:

  1.  We are going to show our work and findings to a wide group of stakeholders Thur 17th Dec
  2.  The public have validated the Online registration process and we collectively understand the issues/pain point
  3.  EA Duty Officer has validated the issuing/update the warning process is better than the existing process and we collectively understand any pain points
  4.  Sets Out the technology stack/components and products that need to be used so we can meet user & business needs
  5.  Can be available, reliable and process the who, the what, where and the why expected volumes at a high peak flooding event through the various channels
  6.  We have a formal development environment that we can issue a warning to others In a format XML/CAPXML??? That other’s could then consume and understand what changes they may need to make
  7.  We could build, change and update it with the skills that we have

# What we are not focusing on:
