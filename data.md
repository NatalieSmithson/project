# Staff Alerts - Data 

Data standards are an essential tool in good data management. By defining, publishing and using data standards, we can improve consistency in our data, so that it is:

* is easier to join it up
* is easier to analyse
* is easier to re-use
* is more reliable for reporting
* can reduce the cost of changing the format at a later date
