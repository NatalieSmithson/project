# Staff Alerts - Handover

## Additional development ideas

1. Create an accessible and intuitive internal interface for:
   1. Managing contacts that
      1. allows for basic staff data maintenance
   1. Managing message that 
      1. allows for the creation and maintenance of messages
   1. Managing groups that
      1. allows for the creation and maintenance of group
   1. Reporting that
      1. provides a simple message history
      1. provides a simple contact history
      1. provides a simple audit log

1. Identify and implement a way to monitor the success of the text messages issued

1. Identify and implement a way to remove duplicate messages before they are issued

1. Create a new IVR service that automatically updates with the information provided in the Staff Alerts service. This will speed up the time it takes to send a message, and simplify the process for ICS staff.

1. Create a new Staff Alerts website that is separate from Reddot. Reddot is a manual system and is very out of date. Ideally, create a new webpage that updates automatically with information provided by the Staff Alerts Service. This will speed up the time it takes to send a message, and simplify the process for ICS staff. Consideration will be needed around the design and the process required to remove existing messages

1. Add the ability to select the approver from an approver list. This will automatically notify the approver there is a message to review.

1. Add the ability to automatically notify ICS once a message has been approved.

1. Automatically add colleagues office locations/Areas to staff who are managers.

1. Allow staff to unsubscribe from groups by texting back a short code to the service i.e. STOP EA-KSL

## Recommendations

1. Standardise the various BCIM offering into a single "brand". The BCIM website is referred to as "Staff Information website" and "BCM web pages" and simply "Business Continuity Management". The hotline is referred to as "Staff Information Line" and "Staff Information Helpline". We would recommend continuing the Staff Alerts brand:
s
   1. Staff Alerts - the service for creating, approving and sending messages
   1. Staff Alerts Texts
   1. Staff Alerts Website
   1. Staff Alerts Helpline
