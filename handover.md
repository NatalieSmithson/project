# Staff Alerts - Handover

## Recommendations

1. Standardise the various BCIM offersing into a single "brand". The BCIM website is referred to as "Staff Information website" and "BCM web pages" and simply "Business Continuity Management". The hotline is reffred to as "Staff Information Line" and "Staff Information Helpline". We would recommend contining the Staff Alerts brand:
  * Staff Alerts Service - the platform for creating, approving and sending messages
  * Staff Alerts Texts
  * Staff Alerts website
  * Staff Alerts Helpline

1. Create a new IVR service that automatically updates with the information provided in the Staff Alerts service. This will speed up the time it takes to send a message, and simplify the process for ICS staff.

1. Create a new Staff Alerts website that is seperate from Reddot. Reddot is a manual system and is very out of date. Ideally, create a new webpage that updates automatically with information provided by the Staff Alerts Service. This will speed up the time it takes to send a message, and simplify the process for ICS staff. Consideration will be needed around the design and the process required to remove existing messages
