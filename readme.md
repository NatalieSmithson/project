* [Week 1](/updates/week1.md) - beginning 14 September

## Background

The Staff Alerts service will provide a centralised facility which can rapidly inform Environment Agency (EA) staff of notifiable events via text message, the Staff Information website and Helpline. Clear communications are vital to business delivery, so a consistent and rapid method of creating, approving and sending messages is critical.

The intention is for this service to potentially replace the existing EA Text Alerts service which is hard to maintain and manage. The currently in progress "Defra Single Group Text Alert Service" project does **not** intend to replace the existing EA Text Alerts service.


## Goals

* To build a service to notify staff about incidents affecting EA sites and 16 operational areas
* To create a quick, user-friendly and low-cost service
* To allow staff to “self-manage” their details
* To design a service that can be re-used by others


## Objectives

1. Identify and implement a way to securely obtain, maintain and store the necessary staff data across the organisation - following GDPR requirements

1. Identify and implement a way to allow staff to securely register, maintain and remove their own data from the service - following GDPR requirements

1. Create an accessible and intuitive internal interface that:
    1. has a secure user login mechanism
    1. allows for the selection of (multiple) groups
    1. allows for the creation of various messages types
    1. allows for "approval" of messages before sending
    1. allows for the issuing of messages
    
1. Identify and implement a way to send text messages to relevant staff using GOV.UK Notify

1. Fully document the approach, design, implementation and next steps for full service implementation

1. Handover for future management and delivery to Internal Digital Services

* Ability to re-use components from XWS (NeXt Warning System) development
* Ability to open source our work for re-use by Defra or others without restriction
* Provide a seamless transition to Internal Digital Services for future management
