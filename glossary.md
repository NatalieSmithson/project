FWIS also allows flood warning duty officers to amend the status and current situation, if they are unable to access the FWS and it provides flood warning information to other services used by the public, such as the Floodline Call Agents and FIS.

**Quickdial (QD)**  
Target areas that are used to put messages on the Floodline IVR have a Quickdial code associated with them. Customers accessing information on the IVR can use this Quickdial code to go straight to the information for that target area.

**Targeted Flood Warning Service (TFWS)**  
The TFWS provides a service for customers with multiple assets at risk of flooding. It is typically used by responders and businesses. It enables them to receive bespoke messages and summary information which relates their assets to any flood alerts and flood warnings in force. The TFWS is automatically updated when messages are issued from FWS.

**User**
